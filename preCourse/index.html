    <h1>StumbleCrawl</h1>
    <div id="sub"><em>We don't stay down!</em></div>


    <div class="d1">Stumble, crawl, take a minute, then get back up and finish what you started. We all trip, not all of
        us recover. Sometimes life seems determined to keep you down in the muck, don't let it. </div>

    <div class="d1">People, and yes that means you, are incredibly resilient. We can bounce back from almost anything.
        Sure, there will be times when you can't even pull yourself up, that's when you crawl. Crawl your sorry butt to
        the nearest source of help and then take their hand, stand up, and get on with it. </div>
    <div class="d1">An object at rest stays at rest, an object in motion stays in motion. If you stop at that first
        stumble and don't MOVE then there you'll stay. Direction isn't nearly as important as motion. Keep moving even
        if you don't quite know where you're going. The signposts will appear soon enough and you can alter your course
        as needed, but you'll never see those signs if you're face down in the dirt.</div>
    <h3>Falling down doesn't mean staying down!</h3>
